<h1><a id="Hacking_a_ProgComp_with_Side_Channels_0"></a>Hacking a ProgComp with Side Channels</h1>
<p>As of this writing, I have the best score on <a href="https://goc.vivint.com/problems/invasion/leaderboard">this Game of Codes problem</a> by a factor of 10. <b>I cheated to get it.</b> Here’s how.</p>
<p><a href="https://goc.vivint.com/">Game of Codes</a> is a programming 
competition that follows the typical progcomp format. There are 10 
problems, each with two or three test cases. When you submit your code, 
it is fed inputs via stdin, and writes solutions to stdout. Each correct
 answer earns you a point; the leaderboard ranks the submitted programs 
firstly by points, and secondly by the lowest elapsed time for your 
program to complete the test cases.</p>
<p>That last bit is important, because it means that the programmer <em>must not be allowed to see the test cases</em>.
 If they could, it would be trivial to hard-code the correct answer for 
each test input. This isn’t a problem in progcomps like <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>,
 because they don’t score you based on execution time, only submission 
time. But when speed matters, gaining knowledge of the test inputs 
allows you to write the theoretically-optimal program for a given 
problem: read input, consult answer table, write output. Two syscalls 
and a few microseconds of array lookups.</p>
<p>Now, Game of Codes tries very hard to hide the test inputs. They 
don’t allow you to see the output of your program; only whether it 
succeeded or failed. This prevents you from simply printing the test 
inputs to stdout. Furthermore, your program is run in a restricted 
environment: the filesystem is read-only, and network calls are blocked.
 So you can’t sneak the inputs out via HTTP request or other 
network-based means.</p>
<p>But one hole is left unplugged: the leaderboard lists the execution 
time of each submission. And that’s a side channel. Specifically, we can
 use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attack</a>
 to recover information about the test inputs, using only the recorded 
execution time of the program. This is the attack I used to achieve a 
(near-) optimal time on the “Invasion” problem linked above. But first, 
to understand the method, let’s look at a simpler problem.</p>
<h3><a id="Islands_12"></a>Islands</h3>
<p><a href="https://goc.vivint.com/problems/islands">Here’s the problem description</a>
 for “Islands,” a program that is easy prey for the timing attack. When 
conducting the attack, we want to minimize the amount of information 
that we have to transmit. Notice that although the example input is 
fairly verbose, the example <em>output</em> is a small set of small 
numbers. So in this case we will leak the output rather than the input. 
The distinction doesn’t matter much; either way, we’ll be able to 
construct our optimal solution.</p>
<p>First, we need to solve the problem, since the Game of Codes server 
only tells you the execution time of successful tests. Once we have a 
working program, we can establish baseline timings for each test case. 
My program ran each test case runs in about 30ms. We then introduce our 
leak code by adding a <code>sleep</code> call. We’ll sleep for <em>n</em> seconds, where <em>n</em> is the value we want to leak, starting with the first output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> main() {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// ... solution code goes here ...</span>
    
    time.Sleep(time.Second * outputs[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>])
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we push this code to the Game of Codes server, we get a response that looks like this (actual values changed):</p>
<pre><code>Compiling...
&gt; go build -o run
Compilation success in 267.644988ms
Running examples...
Example 1 success in 2.032274213s
Running tests...
Test 1 success in 4.045206722s
Test 2 success in 7.037433879s
1 examples succeeded.
2 tests succeeded in 14.082640601s.
</code></pre>
<p>Boom, we just leaked our first outputs! Test 1 ran in 4 seconds, so 
its first output is 4; likewise, the first output of Test 2 is 7. The 
example ran in 2 seconds, so the first output should be a 2 – and we can
 confirm from the problem description that it is.</p>
<p>Now it’s just a matter of repeating this process for <code>output[1]</code>, <code>output[2]</code>,
 and so on. We’ll know when we’ve found all of them when the tests start
 failing – that means the program crashed due to accessing an index of <code>outputs</code> that doesn’t exist. We can also check our progress as we go by overwriting the contents of <code>outputs</code>
 with our leaked values before writing them to stdout. If our leaked 
values are incorrect, overwriting the actual values will cause the test 
to fail.</p>
<p>Once we know all the outputs, we need to tackle another problem: 
matching each input with its output. In other words, we need a way for 
our program to identify which input it’s processing. Unsurprisingly, we 
can leak this information the same way as before. In the case of 
“Islands,” the first number of the input is sufficient to distinguish 
between the test cases. But since the input numbers are large, we can’t 
multiply them by a full second like we did for the outputs – the test 
would take too long to run. Instead, we’ll sleep for <code>inputs[0] * time.Millisecond</code>.
 But when we do this, we run into a new complication: variance. If the 
execution time varies by more than 1ms compared to our baseline, then 
our leaked value will be wrong. It could take quite a few tries to 
recover the correct input.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can improve upon this by using a two-stage approach. 
First, we’ll use a 1ms multiplier to get an “initial guess” for the 
input value. Then we’ll run the program again, but this time subtract 
our guess from the input, and multiply the remainder by 1s. For example,
 let’s say our baseline execution time is 26ms. On our first run, we 
multiply by 1ms, and the execution time is 854ms. That gives us an 
initial guess of 828. On the second run, we subtract 828 from <code>input</code>
 and multiply by 1s, resulting in an execution time of 4.024s. This 
tells us (with high confidence) that the actual value is 828 + 4 = 832.</p>
<p>Once we’ve matched each test input to its outputs, we can write the “optimal program” (actual values changed):</p>
<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> main() {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// read 4 bytes to determine which test we're running</span>
    fst := <span class="hljs-built_in">make</span>([]<span class="hljs-typename">byte</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>)
    os.Stdin.Read(fst[:])

    <span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span> <span class="hljs-typename">string</span>(fst) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">"3000"</span>: <span class="hljs-comment">// Example</span>
        os.Stdout.WriteString(<span class="hljs-string">"2\n1\n0\n4\n3\n5\n"</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">"1234"</span>: <span class="hljs-comment">// Test 1</span>
        os.Stdout.WriteString(<span class="hljs-string">"1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n"</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">"5678 "</span>: <span class="hljs-comment">// Test2</span>
        os.Stdout.WriteString(<span class="hljs-string">"1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This performs quite well – but surprisingly, it isn’t fast enough to 
top the scoreboard. I’m not sure why this is, but somehow the top 
program runs 5ms faster than this code. Fortunately, the same is not 
true of…</p>
<h3><a id="Invasion_70"></a>Invasion</h3>
<p>This problem presents some new challenges, but I knew that I could 
get the top leaderboard position if I solved it. When I started, the 
fastest program ran in about 500ms. The nice thing about these optimal 
programs is that their speed is independent of the computational 
complexity of the actual problem; the code is always just a lookup 
table. So I expected that I could submit a solution that ran 
approximately as fast as my Islands solution: 30ms.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://goc.vivint.com/problems/invasion">problem description</a>
 indicates that this problem boils down to computing a bunch of hashes 
and subsequently matching messages to hashes in order to reconstruct the
 original “message chain.” I wrote a straightforward (unoptimized) 
solution, which ran in about 25ms for the first two test inputs, and 
1.5s for the third. Then I set about recovering the outputs.</p>
<p>The expected output for this problem is a bunch of concatenated 
message strings. Recovering all that string data would be tedious, but 
fortunately there’s an easy way to compress it. Since each message comes
 from an element in the input array, we can simply leak the index of 
each message, rather than the messages themselves. To check whether this
 was reasonable, the first thing I leaked was the number of messages in 
each test output. The first test had 4 messages; the second had 19; and 
the third had 501. I could recover the first two manually, but no way 
was I going to leak 501 values by hand. To compound the problem, the 
values I intended to leak were large, which meant that there’s no way I 
could multiply them by 1s; I would need to use the guess-and-check 
strategy mentioned earlier for every value. This called for some 
automation.</p>
<p>I wrote a small Go program that repeatedly generated new code, pushed
 it to the Game of Codes server, parsed the response, and used the 
timing information to generate the next iteration. The generated code 
included a check so that it would fail if it guessed the wrong value; 
the observer could then notice this failure, revert the last commit, and
 attempt to guess the value again. This meant I could mostly let the 
program run unsupervised.</p>
<p>But when I fired up the program, it quickly became apparent that the 
frequency of these “retries” was unacceptably high. My baseline 
execution time of 1.5s had significant variance, causing lots of 
incorrect guesses even when using the two-phase guess-and-check 
approach. Tests also took a long time to run – sometimes as long as 50 
seconds – meaning that a wrong guess could cause a delay of over 2 
minutes. I needed to refine my approach.</p>
<p>After a lot of head-scratching, I had an epiphany that in retrospect 
seemed embarrassingly obvious. By padding the baseline execution time, I
 could reduce the variance, allowing me to decrease the sleep 
multiplier. In code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> main() {
    start := time.Now()
    
    <span class="hljs-comment">// ... solution code goes here ...</span>
    
    time.Sleep(<span class="hljs-number">5</span> * time.Second - time.Since(start))
    time.Sleep(sleepMultiplier * leakedValue)
}
</code></pre>
<p>I measured, and indeed, this approach clamped the variance to a few 
milliseconds. As a result, I was able to drop the sleep multiplier to 
10ms and do away with guess-and-check; most of the time, the first guess
 was accurate enough that a second pass wasn’t needed. I gleefully 
deployed this new code and watched it chug away. This was a slow 
process, since the Game of Codes server was rate-limited to enforce a 
10s delay between each push. But at 15s per value, it only took two 
hours to calculate all 501.</p>
<p>Once all the values were calculated, I constructed a near-optimal solution for the problem (actual values changed):</p>
<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> Example = []<span class="hljs-typename">int</span>{<span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>}

}

<h2><a id="Conclusion_145"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pulling off this hack was pretty fun. People seem to be split on 
whether it counts as cheating or not. It’s true that I only used 
publically-available information – I didn’t exploit a buffer overflow in
 the server code or anything like that – but this is obviously not how 
the problems were intended to be solved. I feel a bit guilty about 
stealing the top leaderboard position from someone who spent a lot of 
time optimizing their code. But hey, I invested a fair amount of time in
 my approach too, so… it’s a wash. For what it’s worth, I don’t plan to 
execute this attack on any other Game of Codes problems, and I 
discourage anyone else from doing so. I hope the Game of Codes team 
found my antics amusing (rather than threatening), and I hope this post
piqued your interest in timing attacks and other side channels.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Update: The Game of Codes team removed my submission from the leaderboard,
but it is still viewable <a href="https://goc.vivint.com/problems/invasion/leaderboard?day=2017-09-22">here</a>. They also posted an announcement
clarifying that hard-coded solutions will not be eligible to win prizes. I
support their decision.</i></p>
