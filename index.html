Hi. I'm Luke.

<a href="mailto:luke@lukechampine.com">Email</a> - <a href="https://github.com/lukechampine">GitHub</a> - About Me - <a href="https://facebook.com/phoneme">Facebook</a> - <a href="https://keybase.io/lukechampine">Keybase</a>


I'm a co-founder at <a href="https://sia.tech">Nebulous</a>, writing software to re-decentralize the Internet.
I studied Computer & Systems Engineering at RPI for 3 years before my long-time
friend <a href="https://github.com/DavidVorick">David</a> and I were bitten by the startup bug. I've previously worked in a
cube at Akamai and Kronos, but I don't think I'm going back to that way of life
anytime soon. I like chess, Taoism, 4chan, ambient music, and eggnog.

Here are some projects I've worked on:

<a href="https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia">Sia</a> (current):
    Distributed cloud storage
<a href="https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia-UI">Sia-UI</a> (current):
    A graphical client for Sia, made with React+Electron
<a href="https://github.com/NebulousLabs/mkvsynth">Mkvsynth</a>:
    Non-linear video editor for Linux

I have also written a number of Go libraries. Typically they exploit dark
corners of the language to make it do things it wasn't designed to do.

<a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/stm">randmap</a>: Efficient, random map access and iteration (<a href="hackmap.html">blog post</a>)
<a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/stm">stm</a>: Software Transactional Memory
<a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/freeze">freeze</a>: Make any Go object immutable via mprotect
<a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/few">few</a>: The fastest possible Go encoder
<a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/jr">jr</a>: A tiny Command Line Interface JavaScript Object Notation Remote Procedure Call client
