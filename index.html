Hi. I'm Luke.

<a href="mailto:luke@lukechampine.com">Email</a> - <a href="https://github.com/lukechampine">GitHub</a> - About Me - <a href="https://twitter.com/lukechampine">Twitter</a> - <a href="https://keybase.io/lukechampine">Keybase</a>


I'm a co-founder at <a href="https://sia.tech">Nebulous</a>, writing software to re-decentralize the Internet.
I studied Computer & Systems Engineering at RPI for 3 years before my long-time
friend <a href="https://gitlab.com/DavidVorick">David</a> and I were bitten by the startup bug. I've previously worked in a
cube at Akamai and Kronos, but I don't think I'm going back to that way of life
anytime soon. Aside from programming, I like ambient music, 4chan, and eggnog.

My main focus right now is <a href="https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/Sia">Sia</a>, a distributed cloud storage platform. I mostly
work on the backend, siad, but have contributed to the frontend, <a href="https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/Sia-UI">Sia-UI</a>, as
well. I also wrote <a href="https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/nanos-app-sia">an app</a> for the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet, and currently
I'm exploring new ways to interact with the Sia network in a personal project
called <a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/us">us</a>.

I primarily program in Go, which I have used to write a number of libraries
and tools. Here are some that I think are especially neat:

<a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/ply">ply</a>: A compile-to-Go language supporting generic container operations
<a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/randmap">randmap</a>: Efficient random map access and iteration (<a href="hackmap.html">blog post</a>)
<a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/freeze">freeze</a>: Make any Go object immutable via mprotect
<a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/jsteg">jsteg</a>: A tool for hiding data in JPEGs

Here are <a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/go-challenge">my solutions</a> to the <a href="http://golang-challenge.org">Go challenge</a>.
Here are <a href="https://github.com/lukechampine/advent">my solutions</a> to the <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>.

I also wrote <a href="progcomp.html">a fun post</a> about side channels.
