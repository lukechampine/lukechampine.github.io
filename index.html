Hi. I'm Luke.

<a href="mailto:luke@lukechampine.com">Email</a> - <a href="http://github.com/lukechampine">GitHub</a> - About Me - <a href="http://lukechampine.blogspot.com">Blog (old)</a> - <a href="resume.pdf">Resume</a>


I'm a co-founder at <a href="http://nebulouslabs.com">Nebulous</a>, writing software to re-decentralize the Internet.
I studied Computer & Systems Engineering at RPI for 3 years before my long-time
friend <a href="http://github.com/DavidVorick">David</a> and I were bitten by the startup bug. I've previously worked in a
cube at Akamai and Kronos, but I don't think I'm going back to that way of life
anytime soon. I prefer Linux to Windows, FP to OOP, and HN to reddit.

Here are some projects I've worked on:

<a href="http://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia">Sia</a> (current):
    Distributed cloud storage. I work on the networking code and scripting system.
<a href="http://github.com/NebulousLabs/mkvsynth">Mkvsynth</a>:
    Non-linear video editor for Linux. I wrote the interpreter.
<a href="http://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core">Tox</a>:
    Secure communication platform. I contributed to Toxic, a CLI frontend.
<a href="http://github.com/lukechampine/alive">Alive</a>:
    Lifespan visualization. I wanted to learn some JavaScript.
<a href="http://github.com/lukechampine/PasteHack">PasteHack</a>:
    Pastebin as a replacement for local storage. Requires a userscript to work.
