Hi. I'm Luke.

<a href="mailto:luke@lukechampine.com">Email</a> - <a href="http://github.com/lukechampine">GitHub</a> - About Me - <a href="http://lukechampine.blogspot.com">Blog (old)</a> - <a href="resume.pdf">Resume</a>


I'm a student at RPI, studying Computer & Systems Engineering. I should probably
be studying Computer Science, but oh well. I've previously worked for Akamai and
Kronos. I'd love to found/join a startup someday. I prefer Linux to Windows, FP
to OOP, and subs to dubs.

Here are some projects I've worked on:

<a href="http://github.com/mkvsynth/mkvsynth">Mkvsynth</a>:
    Non-linear video editor for Linux. I wrote the interpreter.
<a href="http://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core">Tox</a>:
    Secure communication platform. I contributed to Toxic, a CLI frontend.
<a href="http://github.com/lukechampine/alive">Alive</a>:
    Lifespan visualization. I wanted to learn some JavaScript.
<a href="http://github.com/lukechampine/PasteHack">PasteHack</a>:
    Neat hack I conceived of over break. Requires a userscript to work.
