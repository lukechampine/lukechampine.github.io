<h1><a id="I_Formed_a_Contract_with_Every_Host_on_Sia_0"></a>I Formed a Contract with Every Host on Sia</h1>
<p><em>… And The Results May Surprise You!</em> (sorry)</p>
<p>But yes, I used <code>us</code> to identify every active host on Sia and form contracts
with all of them. Then I analyzed their latency and upload/download bandwidth.
If you want the raw data, I’ve made it available as a .csv <a href="https://lukechampine.com/hostdata.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p>My primary motivation in conducting this experiment was to get a general sense
of the health of the Sia network. Playing around with <code>user</code> has shown me that
picking good hosts is tough. Even if you use hosts that are highly-ranked in
the <code>siad</code> host database, they may not perform very well. The most accurate
way to gauge a host’s performance is to actually use it, so I decided to try
them all. I wanted to know: if I used only the best hosts on the network, how
fast could I upload and download? After conducting my experiment, I was able
to find out. (Spoiler alert: pretty fast.)</p>
<h2><a id="Part_1_Forming_Contracts_18"></a>Part 1: Forming Contracts</h2>
<p>To begin, we need a list of all the hosts on the network, which we can get
from the <code>siad</code> API. Then, for each host, we need to query its current prices
and use those prices to calculate the total contract cost; I aimed to store 1
GB of data for 1 week. Finally, we form a contract with the host and save it
to disk. We can do all this in just a few lines of code (error handling
omitted):</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">allHosts, _ := siad.Hosts()
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> _, hostKey := <span class="hljs-keyword">range</span> allHosts {
    host, _ := siad.Scan(hostKey)
    cost := calculateCost(host)
    contractTxn, _ := proto.FormContract(siad, siad, host, cost, start, end)
    renter.SaveContract(contractTxn, hostKey.ShortKey()+<span class="hljs-string">".contract"</span>)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In practice, we also need to skip hosts that are too expensive: I identified
one host that tried to charge me 100,000 SC! Since I was forming small
contracts, I limited the total cost to 10 SC.</p>
<p>I successfully formed contracts with 154 hosts out of the 500 returned by
<code>siad</code>. This was fewer than I hoped, but the good news is that most of the
failures are easily remedied. By far the most common cause of failure was the
host refusing to spend collateral on the contract, which is actually due to a
bug in the host code that will be fixed in v1.4.0. The various causes of
failure are documented in the .csv linked above.</p>
<p>The total cost to form all of the contracts was 217 SC. The mean contract cost
was 1.59 SC, and the median was 1.01 SC. A histogram of contract prices is
shown belown. We can clearly see that most costs fell close to a round number
of SC (either 0, 1, or 3). These round numbers are likely the flat per-
contract fees charged by host; for such small contracts, the upload/download
cost is small compared to the fee.</p>

<h2><a id="Part_2_Analyzing_Performance_58"></a>Part 2: Analyzing Performance</h2>
<p>Next, I loaded each contract, connected to the host, uploaded a sector, and
then downloaded the same sector, recording the latency and throughput of each
operation. The <code>proto.Uploader</code> and <code>proto.Downloader</code> types provide methods
for accessing these statistics (although the API is a bit clunky):</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">contracts, _ := renter.LoadContracts(<span class="hljs-string">"contracts"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">defer</span> contracts.Close()
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> hostKey, contract := <span class="hljs-keyword">range</span> contracts {
    hostIP, _ := siad.ResolveHostKey(hostKey)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// upload a sector</span>
    u, _ := proto.NewUploader(hostIP, contract, currentHeight)
    upDial := u.DialStats()
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sector [renterhost.SectorSize]<span class="hljs-typename">byte</span>
    root, _ := u.Upload(&amp;sector)
    upStats := u.LastUploadStats()
    u.Close()
    <span class="hljs-comment">// add the sector root to the contract</span>
    contract.AppendRoot(root)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// download the sector</span>
    d, _ := proto.NewDownloader(hostIP, contract)
    downDial := d.DialStats()
    d.Sector(&amp;sector, root)
    downStats := d.LastDownloadStats()
    d.Close()
    <span class="hljs-comment">// calculate log stats</span>
    upDialDur := upDial.ProtocolEnd.Sub(upDial.DialStart)
    upProtoDur := upStats.ProtocolEnd.Sub(upStats.ProtocolStart)
    upXferDur := upStats.TransferEnd.Sub(upStats.TransferStart)
    downDialDur := downDial.ProtocolEnd.Sub(downDial.DialStart)
    downProtoDur := downStats.ProtocolEnd.Sub(downStats.ProtocolStart)
    downXferDur := downStats.TransferEnd.Sub(downStats.TransferStart)
    log.Printf(<span class="hljs-string">"%v,%v,%v,%v,%v,%v,%v"</span>, hostKey,
               upDialDur, upProtoDur, upXferDur,
               downDialDur, downProtoDur, downXferDur)
}
</code></pre>
<p>(“protocol” means all communication that isn’t sending raw file data, e.g.
when exchanging revision signatures. The new RPC protocol in v1.4.0 eliminates
much of this overhead.)</p>
<p>I was able to collect statistics on the majority of the 154 hosts, but some
complained about underpayment (likely due to desynchronization), and a few
said they had no storage space remaining! This demonstrates the importance of
real testing: until you actually attempt to upload, there’s no way to be sure
if a host is lying about their storage space. As with the contract formation,
I’ve included these errors in the .csv.</p>
<p>Below are some charts visualizing the latency and throughput of the hosts.</p>
<p><img src="https://lukechampine.com/hostlatency.png" alt="Latency histogram"></p>
<p>The mean latency was 183 ms, with 5th/25th/50th/75th/95th percentile values of
46/105/135/222/455 ms respectively. These numbers are obviously location-dependent;
my test node was located in New England.</p>
<p><img src="https://lukechampine.com/hostupload.png" alt="Upload histogram"></p>
<p><img src="https://lukechampine.com/hostdownload.png" alt="Download histogram"></p>
<p>The mean upload speed was 10.76 Mbps, with 5th/25th/50th/75th/95th percentile
values of 2.31/7.70/10.9/14.0/18.4 Mbps respectively. The mean download speed
was 17.61 Mbps, with percentile values of 1.47/5.27/11.4/20.0/50.1 Mbps.</p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that these figures include the protocol overhead that
will be greatly reduced in v1.4.0. If the protocol overhead is omitted, the
raw throughput percentiles are 3.69/17.9/28.0/36.2/52.9 Mbps for upload and
1.50/5.50/13.6/25.2/66.8 Mbps for download. This gives us a rough idea of the
maximum performance we can extract from the current host hardware.</p>
<h2><a id="Part_3_Bestcase_Streaming_on_Sia_132"></a>Part 3: Best-case Streaming on Sia</h2>
<p>For fun, I decided to upload a file to just the 10 fastest hosts and measure
the upload/download performance. For this set of hosts, the mean upload speed
was 15 Mbps and the mean download speed was 74 Mbps. Since we can upload and
download in parallel, our ideal transfer speeds are 150 Mbps up and 740 Mbps
down! How close can we get to this in practice?</p>
<p>My test file was a 5-minute 1080p video with a bitrate of about 4000 kbps,
totalling 141 MB. Since I wanted to maximize peak throughput, I used a
10-of-10 erasure code, meaning there was zero redundancy. When I uploaded the
file, my bandwidth was clearly saturated: it grew rapidly to 40 Mbps and then
hovered there before tailing off at the end of each chunk, creating a
characteristic pattern:</p>
<p><a href="https://lukechampine.com/uploadspeed.png"><img src="https://lukechampine.com/uploadspeed.png" alt="File upload speed"></a></p>
<p>To test the true maximum speed of the hosts, I transferred the
contracts to a VPS and re-uploaded the file there, where I saw an average
upload speed of 120 Mbps, with peaks of 300 Mbps – wow! Downloading was less
consistent; some hosts clearly outperformed others, which hurt the overall
throughput because I was bottlenecked by the slowest host. Still, I achieved
an average throughput of 100 Mbps, again with peaks of 300 Mbps! And this was
with just 10 hosts – if I had used more, 1 Gbps would likely be achievable.</p>
<p>Next, I re-uploaded the file, this time optimized for streaming. I used a
5-of-10 code so that I could disable the slowest five hosts, and I also
recorded a checksum of every 64 KiB chunk of the file. This allowed me to
download 64 KiB at a time instead of the standard 4 MiB sector size, which
greatly reduces seek latency when streaming.</p>
<p>Once the upload finished, I ran <code>user serve</code> to make the file available for
streaming over HTTP. The video loaded quickly and I observed no stuttering.
Seek times were generally between 1.5 and 2.5 seconds. It’s satisfying to see
that Sia can perform as well as Netflix or YouTube, except perhaps in regard
to seek times. (And I’m confident that seek times will shrink with the v1.4.0
RPC protocol.)</p>
<p>Lastly, I tried uploading a file to as many hosts as possible. I used a
100-of-120 erasure code, which is pretty crazy: it means my file can withstand
up to 20 hosts going offline, and yet the redundancy is only 1.2x! Of course,
there are severe performance issues with doing this: you need to make 100 TCP
connections every time you want to download the file, and you’ll be
bottlenecked by the slowest of 100 hosts. (It took me over 40 seconds to
download my 57 KB .jpg!)</p>
<h2><a id="Conclusion_179"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sia’s fundamental thesis – that a decentralized network can compete with
centralized providers on both quality and cost – is reaffirmed by these
results. However, the network still has a long way to go before this sort of
performance becomes the norm. Part of this depends on software (ensuring that
hosts are making the best use of their bandwidth, storage, and collateral),
and part depends on enticing new hosts to join the network.</p>
<p>Sia is a marketplace for storage, and marketplaces work best when all parties
have perfect information. Unfortunately, renters and hosts today are very
limited in their ability to observe and react to market conditions. I would
love to see a website that regularly conducts the sort of tests I did here, in
order to provide market information to both renters and hosts. If you're
interested in building a service like this, get in touch!</p>
