What is a Monad?
================

<i>Note: this article assumes some familiarity with Haskell.</i>

A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors.

That's usually given as a joke answer, but it's true. And I think it's the
proper way to explain what monads are and why they're useful.

First, let's go over what a monoid is. A monoid has three components:

- A category
- An associative binary operation on that category
- An "identity value" for the operation

The easiest example is addition on the natural numbers. Here, the identity
value is 0, because adding 0 to any number does not change it. Also note that
addition is an associative operation; that is, (1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3).

Similarly, multiplication is a monoid with identity value 1. However, we can
easily show that subtraction and division are <i>not</i> monoids, because they are
not associative: (1 - 2) - 3 ≠ 1 - (2 - 3). This makes it clear that
subtraction and division are really just special cases of the addition and
multiplication monoids.

Given this definition, we can easily construct our own monoid. For example,
our category could be grocery lists, with the identity value being an empty
list. Our binary operation will be to take two lists and merge their elements,
deleting any duplicate items. You can verify for yourself that this operation
is associative.
The point is: monoids aren't just a mathematical oddity, they're an
abstraction that we can use to our advantage. As an example, we can define a
<span>fold</span> function (also known as <span>reduce</span>) on any monoid. Start by setting an
"accumulator" variable to monoid's identity value. Then successively apply the
monoid operation to the accumulator and each element of the input list. With
addition, this yields the sum of the list. With multiplication, it yields the
product. And because monoids are associative, we can easily parallelize this
operation.

Now the only missing piece is endofunctors. Once we understand endofunctors,
we'll have a complete picture of what a monad is. In category theory, a
functor is a mapping from one category to another. For example, when you turn
the dial on your stove, you're mapping the category of rotation to the
category of heat. An endofunctor is a special case: it's a mapping from a
category to itself. Thus, most of the mathematical functions you are familiar
with are endofunctors, because they map one number to another.

Finally, we can turn to programming. In functional programming, we generally
only see one kind of monad: those whose endofunctor's category is <i>types</i>. In
other words, throw out the term "endofunctor," and replace it with "function."
And when you hear "monad," think "a monoid in the category of functions from
one type to another."
So now we have a rough idea of what a monad looks like. It's a category
(functions from type A to type B), an operation that composes two such
functions, and an identity function. Generally, the tricky part is in the
composing. We need to take two functions with signature <span>A -> B</span>, and produce
a new function with the same signature. This involves some "wrapping and
unwrapping," which is why you'll hear people telling you that monads are like
burritos (more on that later).

I know this is all very abstract, so I'll break out everyone's favorite monad
example: <span>Maybe</span>. <span>Maybe</span> is commonly used to compose functions that can fail,
such that if any individual function fails, the whole chain will fail. First,
let's make an important distinction: <span>Maybe</span> is not a monad. <span>Maybe</span> is a <i>type</i>
that has a monad <i>instance</i>. A <span>Maybe</span> value can be either <span>Just x</span> or <span>Nothing</span>. But
the <span>Maybe</span> <i>monad</i> deals with <i>functions</i> with the signature <span>x -> Maybe x</span>. Its
binary operator works like this: we are given two functions, <span>f</span> and <span>g</span>, with
signature <span>x -> Maybe x</span>. We return a new function that first calls <span>f</span>. If the
result is <span>Nothing</span>, the function immediately returns <span>Nothing</span>. Otherwise, it
returns <span>g(result)</span>. We also need an identity function. Our goal is that if we
use our binary operator on the identity function and some other function <span>f</span>,
the result will be the same as calling <span>f</span> alone. We accomplish this by defining
an identity function that, given <span>x</span>, returns <span>Just x</span>. In Haskell, the binary
operator is called <span>bind</span> (or <span>>>=</span>), and the identity function is called <span>return</span>.

Okay. Let's look at what it would be like to use <span>Maybe</span> if it didn't
have a monad instance. If you've ever used a language that has pointers, this
should look familiar. In this example, we want to call a bunch of functions,
each of which returns a pointer to an integer. Here's how it would normally
look in C:

	int *z;
	int *x = foo();
	if (x != NULL) {
		int *y = bar(*x);
		if (y != NULL) {
			z = baz(*y);
		}
	}

One way to clean this up would be to have <span>bar</span> and <span>baz</span> check for a <span>NULL</span>
argument internally, and propagate <span>NULL</span> if their argument is null. Then we
could write:

	int *x = foo();
	int *y = bar(x);
	int *z = baz(y);

Or even:

	int *z = baz(bar(foo()));

Here's where the beauty of monads comes in. In this example, we needed to
change the internal behavior of <span>bar</span> and <span>baz</span> in order to wire things up
properly. But if we have the <span>bind</span> operator, we can implement this change at
the <i>composition level</i>. So instead of modifying <span>bar</span> and <span>baz</span>, we can simply
write:

	// C implementation of Maybe's bind operation
	int* bind(int* (*fn)(*int), int *x) {
		if (x == NULL) return NULL;
		return fn(*x);
	}

	int *z = bind(baz, bind(bar, foo()));

Or, with pretty Haskell syntax:

	z = foo >>= bar >>= baz

As you can see, polymorphic types are a huge convenience here, because we can
use a single <span>>>=</span> operator for every monad. In fact, they're pretty essential
to making monads useful at all. That's why you don't see them much outside of
Haskell.

Part of the reason why monads are so notoriously hard to explain is that they
are a very abstract concept. They have a wide range of uses, from error
propagation to parsing to concurrency to I/O, but examining any individual use
won't give you the full picture. Let's revisit some alternative monad
explanations and see if they make more sense now.

- <a href="http://zacharyvoase.com/2014/04/30/monads">Monads are programmable semicolons</a>. This just means that monads allow you to
  specify how operations should be composed. The analogy is muddled somewhat
  because semicolons delimit <i>statements</i>, whereas Haskell doesn't have
  statements — only expressions.

- <a href="http://blog.plover.com/prog/burritos.html">Monads are burritos</a>. This is referring to how <span>bind</span> "wraps and unwraps" types
  in order to compose operations.

The tricky part is not understanding monads, it's understanding how to use
them in real code. The best way to do this is to study examples of existing
monads, and discover how their properties make them useful, powerful, and
elegant.

- The <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/Maybe">Maybe</a> monad you've already seen.

- Surprisingly, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/List">List</a> has a monad instance as well. It is used for modeling
  nondeterministic computations. This is a good example of how the <span>List</span> type
  itself is not a monad, but rather has a monad instance. And though the
  instance is useful, it does not follow directly from the definition of List.

- The <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/State">State</a> monad provides access to shared state.

- In the same vein, the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/IO">IO</a> monad permits side effects in pure code by treating
  the entire outside world as shared state.

I recommend that you study each of these in order to attain monad satori.
