How to Access a Running Binary on Linux
=======================================

Here's a scenario that many sysadmins may have run into:

Weeks ago, you started up a binary on your server. Today it started having
problems, so you want to diagnose it. There's just one problem: the original
binary file has been overwritten or deleted. How can you recover the running
binary in order to probe it?

I suspected that there was a way to do this on Linux, and my suspicion was
soon confirmed. Let's investigate how to do it, and why it works.

Our first step is to look in <span>/proc</span>. We'll need the PID of the binary, which we
can find using <span>pidof</span> or a program like <span>htop</span>. The <span>/proc</span> entry contains a
symlink called <span>exe</span>, which points to the original path of the executable.
That's a fine first step, but it doesn't help us if we overwrote that file.

But the binary data must still exist somewhere, right? Indeed. When we
overwrote our binary, behind the scenes, the OS first unlinks the old file,
then writes the new one. But merely unlinking a file does not (necessarily)
delete it. Since the OS knows that a process is using the file, it won't
remove the data until the process ends.

Back to <span>/proc</span>. There is another file here that we can use: <span>maps</span>. This
file contains a listing of all the files mapped by the process. Using <span>grep</span>, we
can find the mapping of the original executable path, along with a crucial
piece of information: the inode of the file. This is the number immediately
preceding the path of the file.

Now the only question is: how do we recover a file just from its inode? You
might expect this to be straightforward, but no sir. The reason is
permissions. If we could get a file's contents simply using its inode, then we
could bypass file permissions all over the place. So we need a special tool
for this job: <span>debugfs</span>. Fortunately it comes packaged with most distros.

To use debugfs, we must identify the device where the original executable was
located. This can be determined using <span>df /path</span>. Then, running <span>debugfs [device]</span>
will drop us into an interactive shell; or we can use the <span>-R</span> flag to specify a
single command to run. We will also want to supply the <span>-w</span> flag to indicate
that we need write access to the device. The command we will supply is:

    <span>ln &lt;[inode]&gt; /path</span>

where <span>[inode]</span> is the inode found in the <span>/maps</span> file, and <span>/path</span> is the new path
that we want to link the inode to. One quirk to be aware of here is that the
path will be relative to the root of the device. For example, if the mount
point is <span>/home</span>, the above command will link to <span>/home/path</span>.

That's it! We successfully recovered a running binary, and can now perform
diagnostics on it. Here is a bash script that will automatically perform the
steps above:


    #!/bin/bash
    set -e

    pid="$1"
    exepath="$2"
    outpath="$3"

    if [[ -z $outpath ]]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 [PID] [EXEPATH] [OUTPATH]"
        echo "Note that OUTPATH must be relative to the device mount point."
        exit 1
    fi

    # get inode
    inode=$(grep $exepath /proc/$pid/maps | awk 'NR==1{ print $5; }')

    # get device
    dev=$(df $exepath | awk 'NR==2{ print $1; }')

    set -o xtrace
    sudo debugfs -w $dev -R "ln &lt;$inode&gt; $outpath"
